# Web starter

A website starter example using the following stack:

- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) frontend framework
- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) backend
- [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) templating (easily swappable)

_No other pre-/post processors or bundlers for JavaScript or CSS (Babel, PostCSS, Sass, Stylus, etc.) are included._

## Prerequisites

You need to have the following tools installed on your computer:
- A [unix based terminal emulator (command-line)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terminal_emulators#Unix-like) ([Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)) for Mac)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/), preferably installed with [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for source control management
- A text editor for working with code ([Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [GNU Nano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano), [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)), [Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs))

## Usage

Although this repository can be cloned and used directly, it might be more constructive to [setup your project from scratch](steps.md).

This will help you understand what the stack consist of, how it fits together and how to change and tweak things for the projects requirements and your own personal/team taste.
